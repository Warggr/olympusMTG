# Olympus Backlog

**Ceres** - read names from JSON file instead of hard-coding them

**Janus** - create a menu at the start of the game

**Medusa** - implement WeirdCosts

**Athena** - conditional abilities and modal spells

**Prometheus** - have a fully-fledged, learning AI player

**Apollo** - choose at compile-time which libraries to use (e.g. IO options and agents); or whether to use the abstract class and choose at runtime
